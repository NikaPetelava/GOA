        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius was born on April 26, 121, in Rome. He ruled as Roman
          emperor from 161 to 180 AD. He is best known for his philosophical
          work "Meditations," which is a significant source of modern
          understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. Despite his imperial
          duties, Marcus Aurelius remained dedicated to his Stoic principles,
          emphasizing reason, duty, and self-discipline. He passed away on March
          17, 180, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest Stoic
          philosophers.
