      <h3>One Piece</h3>
      <p>
        Monkey. D. Luffy refuses to let anyone or anything stand in the way of
        his quest to become the king of all pirates. With a course charted for
        the treacherous waters of the Grand Line and beyond, this is one captain
        who'll never give up until he's claimed the greatest treasure on Earth:
        the Legendary One Piece!
      </p>

      <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
      <p>
        It is the Taisho Period in Japan. Tanjiro, a kindhearted boy who sells
        charcoal for a living, finds his family slaughtered by a demon. To make
        matters worse, his younger sister Nezuko, the sole survivor, has been
        transformed into a demon herself. Though devastated by this grim
        reality, Tanjiro resolves to become a “demon slayer” so that he can turn
        his sister back into a human, and kill the demon that massacred his
        family.

      <h3>Berserk</h3>
      <p>
        Spurred by the flame raging in his heart, the Black Swordsman Guts
        continues his seemingly endless quest for revenge. Standing in his path
        are heinous outlaws, delusional evil spirits, and a devout child of
        god.Even as it chips away at his life, Guts continues to fight his
        enemies, who wield repulsive and inhumane power, with nary but his body
        and sword—his strength as a human. What lies at the end of his travels?
        The answer is shrouded in the "night." Strain your eyes and stare into
        the dark!
